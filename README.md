## Why I'm doing this?
First of all I have to say, ``music-search`` has been a challenge that I loved to make possible. Build an webapp from scratch in just 6 days was exhausting but I could. Yes, I could!. This is the entry test to become in Compucorp ninja-team of front end.    
They send me an email with some requisites for build a website based on this design: [InVisionApp](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/XVAJ2MMK7#/screens)
Pretty good, seems an easy task. But wait, these are the conditions:
- Write tests for you code
- Include a build process
- Do not use any scaffolding tool or application boilerplate
- Do not use any CSS framework (i.e. Bootstrap, Foundation, or similar)
- Use a CSS preprocessor
- The site must work fine with the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge and IE11
- Include a README file in which you explain your solution

And would be nice if I can...
- Use of design patterns would be a plus
- Use of JS modules would be a plus
- Use of caching and local storage would be a plus
- You may use libraries such as icon packs (font-awesome etc)
- Make your best judgement on font files
- Add anything else that could make us say wow!

So yes, the tricky part is I'm not must use any scaffolding or css framework to make the work easiest. So here's my play. 

## What tools I'll be using?
I've been thinking about what tools I need to use to agilize my work and not 'break the laws', so that's it:
- **Gulp** for automatization of tasks.
- **Sass** for CSS preprocessor.
- **Webpack** for bundle scripts, styles.
- I'll be using modules in Javascript and some es6 syntax so I'll be using **Babel** for transpilling.
- I need to write some tests, that's because I will use **mocha** for testing and **chai** for help with some assertions.

As you can see, I have been some hours setting up all the environment just for write the first hello world, All the files in the ``app/`` folder written "*byHand*". 
If you're Developer you can set the app on dev mode just sentencing:
```bash
$ gulp start
```
That command will be open automatically your browser with the webpage in front, cool.

# Installation

# Conclusion
Perhaps It only took 7 days to deliver the prototype but I can show something of my skills (I think it could make it better, but the time goes against me). However these are a sample of things  I can do. Hope you can understand that I love what I do. I do not intend to give you a perfect code in the first met. Just consider that I can give you results in a remote way, imagine yourself what I do with a team of people with high motivation and creativity.
